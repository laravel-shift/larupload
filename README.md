**Larupload** is a file uploader for Laravel, which is based on ORM and allows users to upload `images`, `videos`, `audios`, and other known file formats.

With Larupload, you can easily upload your files, and it comes with interesting features for uploading videos, audios, and images.

One of the main advantages of using Larupload is that it leverages the Laravel [filesystem](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem). As a result, it is easy to switch between different drivers such as _Local_, _SFTP_, _S3_, and many others.&#x20;

It offers many useful features, including the ability to resize, crop, and optimize uploaded images, as well as manipulate uploaded videos by resizing and cropping them, and creating HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) content from uploaded videos.

Moreover, Larupload can calculate the dominant colors of videos and images, as well as extract their width, height, and duration for videos and audio files
